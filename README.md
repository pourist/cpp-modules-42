# C++ Modules (CPP01 – CPP09)

This repository contains my solutions and notes for the **42 C++ Modules**.
Each module introduces new C++ concepts through small exercises that build on each other.

## Modules

* [**CPP01 – Memory & References**](CPP01/)
  *Stack vs heap, references, pointers, file I/O, switch statement, pointer-to-member functions.*

* [**CPP02 – Ad-hoc Polymorphism & Canonical Form**](CPP02/)
  *Fixed-point numbers, operator overloading, Orthodox Canonical Form.*

* [**CPP03 – Inheritance**](CPP03/)
  *Base/derived classes, constructor chaining, overriding, multiple inheritance.*

* [**CPP04 – Subtype Polymorphism & Abstract Classes**](CPP04/)
  *Virtual functions, abstract classes, interfaces, deep copies, polymorphic destruction.*

* [**CPP05 – Bureaucracy & Forms**](CPP05/)
  *Exceptions, class invariants, abstract forms, template method pattern, concrete form classes.*

* [**CPP06 – Casts**](CPP06/)
  *static\_cast, reinterpret\_cast, const\_cast, dynamic\_cast; RTTI and type identification.*

* [**CPP07 – Templates**](CPP07/)
  *Function templates, iter with function pointers, class templates with dynamic allocation.*

* [**CPP08 – STL Basics**](CPP08/)
  *STL containers & algorithms, iterators, span calculations, adapting stack with iterators.*

* [**CPP09 – STL in Practice**](CPP09/)
  *map for Bitcoin exchange, stack for RPN evaluation, vector/list for sorting and benchmarking.*

## Overall Takeaways

* **CPP01–CPP02** → OOP basics, memory, canonical form.
* **CPP03–CPP05** → Inheritance, polymorphism, abstract classes, exception handling.
* **CPP06** → Safe casting and RTTI.
* **CPP07–CPP09** → Templates and STL containers in real problems.
